## Summary

This Northcoders News API is a solo backend project for the Northcoders Bootcamp.

## Hosted

The hosted version of this project is available [here](https://nc-news-leanne.herokuapp.com/).

## Connecting to the databases

Create two new environment variable files using .env.\*, but replace the wildcard (\*) with test and development.

Within these two files, add:

```
PGDATABASE=database_name
```

Replace "database_name" with `nc_news` and `nc_news_test` in the correct file.

Do not add ; to the end.
